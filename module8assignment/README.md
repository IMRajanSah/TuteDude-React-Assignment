Objective: The goal of this assignment is to build a functional shopping cart using React. You will implement various components, manage state effectively, and use advanced concepts like context, reducers, portals, and refs.
Instructions:
Follow the step-by-step guidelines below to complete the assignment:
1. Project Setup
Set up a new React project using Vite or Create React App.


Install necessary dependencies.


2. Component Creation
Create a Header component that includes a cart button.


Design a Meals component to display a list of available meals.


Develop an IndividualMealItem component to display each meal.


3. Implementing Forms & Modals
Add a form for users to add meals to the cart.


Create a Cart component to display selected items.


Use a React Portal to display the cart as a modal.


4. State Management
Manage cart and modal state effectively using React state and props.


Implement a cart context to manage global cart data.


Use the created context inside necessary components.


5. Using Reducers
Implement a reducer function to handle cart operations (adding and removing items).


Extend the reducer logic to handle more complex scenarios.


6. Working with Refs
Use Refs and Forward Refs where applicable in form handling.


7. Outputting and Updating Cart Items
Display selected cart items dynamically.


Allow users to remove items from the cart.


Submission Requirements:
Push your code to GitHub and share the repository link.


Provide a brief report (1-2 pages) explaining your implementation process and challenges faced.


Ensure proper UI styling and responsiveness.
